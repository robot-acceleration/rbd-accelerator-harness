# rbd-accelerator-harness

This repo is meant to serve as a harness for code generated by the [RoboShape code generator](https://github.com/robot-acceleration/roboshape-codegen).
We build and simulate our generated accelerators from this repo.

The READMEs in this repo are outdated from a previous internal version, but will be
updated with build and simulation instructions in the next few days!
